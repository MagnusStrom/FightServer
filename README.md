# FightServer
one day, i wanted to make a fight game(i think cuz i was watching rick nad morty and i wanted to see rick fight idk)

and then, i wanted to make it online. so i made a server. this is that server.

to run,install and do `node index.js`.

old index.js is an old version of the server that works with games.json because i needed a real time server.
